# Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer

ðŸ§© ðŸŽ­ ðŸŽ¬ ðŸ¤–

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A sentiment analysis system that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using TF-IDF with NumPy, logistic regression, and neural networks - all implemented from scratch without ML libraries.

## Background

**Problems solved:**

* Subjective manual review analysis
* Lack of accessible text classification tools
* Over-reliance on complex libraries

**Personal motivation:**
As a cinema enthusiast and AI student, I wanted to create a transparent system that reveals the inner workings of NLP algorithms.

**Importance:**

* Demonstrates text processing fundamentals
* Provides educational code for students
* 100% customizable with no frameworks

## How is it used?

**Workflow:**

1. Training:

    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```

2. Prediction:

    ```bash
    python src/predict.py "excellent movie"
    ```

**Use cases:**

* Streaming platforms for review analysis

* Small businesses understanding customer feedback

* Educational tool for AI courses

## Data sources and AI methods

Data source:

* Custom review dataset (50 samples) + optional IMDB Dataset

| Method      | Implememtation | Accuracy |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------  |
| TF-IDF       | Manual NumPy vectorization kernel | -       |
| Logistic Regression   | From-scratch algorithm | 80%        |
| Neural Network | 2-layer (ReLU + Sigmoid) | 85% |

## Challenges

**Limitations:**

* Only works with known vocabulary

* Lower accuracy than transformer solutions

* Requires retraining for new domains

**Ethical considerations:**

* Potential training data biases

* Not suitable for critical automated decisions

## What next?

**Planned improvements:**

* Add Flask web interface

* Implement Word2Vec manually

* Multi-language support

**Required assistance:**

* UI/UX designers

* Contributors to expand datasets

## Acknowledgments

* Inspired by University of Helsinki's "Building AI" course

* Code structure adapted from Implementing NLP from Scratch

* Sample dataset created by author for educational purposes
